# FDFZ Luogu

[中文版 README](https://github.com/rice0208/fdfz_luogu/blob/master/README_zh.md)

Here comes the answers to problems provided in assignment of FDFZ (High School Affiliated to Fudan University) at [luogu.com.cn](https://www.luogu.com.cn).

## Why this repository?

Recently many of my classmates asked for my help when finishing their assignment. For convenience, I published my answers in this GitHub repository, so that the answers can be public instead of private. Everyone has access to this repository and I may not send every answer at direct messages.

Also as a collection of these problems, this repository can store the answers written. So that if someday I have to get my answers, I may check my GitHub repository instead of visiting luogu.

## How to use this repository?

If you want to copy the answers given in the repository, please follow the steps given:

**Step 1** Find the problem in the ordered list given below. For example, problem 「游泳时间」 is No.1.

**Step 2** Open directory /2022, then visit the file corresponding to the number. (e.g. No.1 is p01.py) Copy the source code, but only the main script. For program No.1, just copy:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())

m = ((c - a) * 60 + (d - b))

print(m // 60, m % 60)
```

**Step 3** Paste the answer at luogu. This repository is licensed under MIT, so you can copy it anywhere.

**Step 4** Edit the answer a little, I believe both you and I **do not hope that we are found cheating when teachers check our assignment**.
